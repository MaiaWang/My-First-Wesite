  <p>Hi, my name is Maia. I am a product manager in JD.com, one of the Chinese biggest online retailing companies in Fortune 500.
I work in the application product team and am mainly responsible for the core modules in our app. We use JavaScript on the front end, and Java on the backend side to realize the connection. So I am quite familiar with how to build functions from zero as well as the product iteration process.
As for programming, I have a solid foundation of Java JavaScript, and Python, and also experienced in HTML, CSS, MySQL, and MongoDB. The personalization project I have designed and implemented on our messaging system not only realizes the diversity of functions but also improves the efficiency of information distribution.
Apart from that, I have done several projects including a webpage on personalized movie recommendations and an android app about local event posting and searching. With a strong background in computer science engineering and project management, I believe I am competent to be a software engineer in any company.
